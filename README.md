This project was implemented during the fifth year of my undergraduate program, focusing on data manipulation and analysis to derive insights from a provided dataset.

A raw dataset was received that required cleaning and restructuring for effective analysis. Utilizing Python and relevant libraries, data manipulation tasks such as filtering, aggregating, and reshaping were performed.

Queries were created to explore the dataset and answer specific questions regarding trends and patterns. By executing these queries, useful insights were extracted, demonstrating the application of data analysis techniques to work with real-world data effectively.
